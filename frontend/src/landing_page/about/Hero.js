              We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2010 with the
              goal of breaking all barriers that traders and investors face in
              India in terms of cost, support, and technology. We named the
              company Zerodha, a combination of Zero and "Rodha", the Sanskrit
              word for barrier. <br /> <br />
              Today, our disruptive pricing models and in-house technology have
              made us the biggest stock broker in India. <br /> <br />

              our powerful ecosystem of investment platforms, contributing over
              15% of all Indian retail trading volumes.
